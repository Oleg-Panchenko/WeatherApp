# WeatherApp
Weather App From Angela Yu Course.
In this App I learned how to:
- Create a dark-mode enabled app.
- Get user input using UITextField.
- Work with delegate pattern.
- Parse JSON using JSON Decoder.
- Use URLSession.
- Use GCD to fetch the main thread.
- Use Core Location to get the current location from the phone GPS.
